# Karera — Horse Racing Clone

A pari-mutuel horse racing game with centralized multi-player betting, built from scratch using captured assets and design references.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla TypeScript + Canvas 2D (Vite)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + WebSocket (server/)
- **Auth**: Phone-number login with SHA-256 salted password hashing
- **Betting**: Centralized pari-mutuel pool via WebSocket

## Quick Start

### 1. Install & Build Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Start the Betting Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:3001` (serves WebSocket + static files).

### 3. Start the Dev Frontend (optional, for development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173` — proxies WebSocket to the game server.

## Default Accounts

| Phone | Password | Role | Balance |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| `09123456789` | `1234` | Player | ₱1,000.00 |
| `admin` | `admin123` | Admin | — |

Admins can create player accounts and load balances from the admin panel.

## How It Works

### Race Flow

1. **Login** → Phone + password authentication
2. **Bet** → Place WIN/PLACE/SHOW or FORECAST bets on horses
3. **Auto-start** → When 2+ horses have bets (from any players), a 60-second countdown begins
4. **Race** → Server locks the pool, house takes 10%, race simulation runs locally
5. **Payout** → Winners split the net pool pro-rata (pari-mutuel dividend)
6. **Next Race** → Return to betting for the next race number

### Betting Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| WIN | Horse must finish 1st |
| PLACE | Horse must finish 1st or 2nd |
| SHOW | Horse must finish 1st, 2nd, or 3rd |
| FORECAST | Pick 1st AND 2nd in exact order |

### Pari-Mutuel Payout

- All WIN bets go into a single pool
- House takes 10% off the top at lock
- Net pool is split among winning bets pro-rata
- Dividend = (pool × 0.9) ÷ total winning bets
- WIN payout = stake × dividend
